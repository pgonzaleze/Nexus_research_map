Equity Considerations in Ocean Governance: The Role of the Blue Economy,"Ana Spalding,
Oregon State University (Marine and Coastal Policy)",Ana Spalding,44.56884494,-123.2785589,Ricardo de Ycaza,"This project will explore how the blue economy (including ocean industries such as fisheries, transportation, energy, and tourism) is being woven into national and international perspectives on the future of ocean governance under a sustainable development agenda. We will develop a case study in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Coast (ETP) of Panama to address broader questions concerning inclusivity and social equity in ocean governance.",Research,
Indigenous Scholarship Approach and its Application to MPA Design,"Ana Spalding,
Oregon State University (Marine and Coastal Policy)",Ana Spalding,44.56884494,-123.2785589,Risako Sakai,"This project will look into Indigenous scholarship applied to examine how spatial management models (ICCA, OECM, and IPLC) respect the interests of Indigenous communities and their traditional tenure systems. In this context, Indigenous scholarship indicates studies of and by Indigenous peoples. Regions will be Oceanian islands, in particular, French Polynesia, Fiji, and Samoa. This study is in collaboration with Chris McOwen at UNEP-WCMC.",Complete,
Understanding social outcomes and enabling conditions for Marine Protected Area effectiveness,"Ana Spalding,
Oregon State University (Marine and Coastal Policy)",Ana Spalding,44.56884494,-123.2785589,Risako Sakai,"In advance of the official announcement of a new global spatial conservation target of 30% by 2030, several countries have claimed that they had already achieved this target. However, achieving this target spatially says little about the effectiveness of protections or how it affects coastal populations. Furthermore, not all MPAs are the same: they can range from fully protected ‚Äòno-take‚Äô areas to sites with minimal protection that allow extractive activities; and, frequently, protections are unequally distributed in space and time. As such, this project seems to further explore innovative and comprehensive ways to assess MPA effectiveness, rather than simply quantifying them in number and spatial extent. Specific activities include improved assessment (and communication) of social outcomes, and a process to emphasize the need for and application of best conditions for desired MPA outcomes including ensuring an equitable and just social, cultural, and regulatory context as well as accessible and inclusive knowledge and information sharing.

In particular, the study focuses on ocean restoration as celebrated nature-based solution to environmental degradation of ocean life. Using feminist decolonial theory, the project: 1) critically reflects on established notions of nature and care in ocean restoration programs, and its friction with situated human-ocean entanglements, including indigenous understandings thereof, 2) examines how epistemological and ontological asymmetries (ways of knowing and enacting the ocean) are sustained in ocean restoration, and 3) explores and develops experimental methodologies that foster dialogues across difference for ocean rehabilitation to be practiced on (more) equitable terms.

The initial step will be to identify critical missing data and knowledge gaps and the differences in metrics used to support oceans and human health decisions. Included in these, would be both gender, age, and place-based decision analytics. Additionaly, using risk based frameworks allows us to examine a variety of ocean impacts, helps to facilitate this dialogue, and identify important points for intervention and policy implications. Considerations of wellbeing and cultural context frequently use semi-quantitative metrics and non-traditional knowledge for informing risk-based decisions. These are commonly lost in research, policy dialogues, and decisions.",Research,

That's why it is essential to make our blue economy more resilient, which demands innovations such as farmed aquacultures designed to be resistant to sudden climate change.¬† Digital tools are needed which can help aquaculture industries to adjust to ever-changing conditions in the oceans. Federal and provisional governments need to provide financial protections to fish farming companies to protect them from catastrophic losses. This project aims to understand 1) how climate change affects the blue economy and how it can be made more resilient to coop such challenges. 2) how the use of technology and rigorous policymaking can help protect the livelihoods of families and aquaculture companies that are in danger of losing to a rapidly changing climate. Considering these two aspects, we can avoid a climate disaster to our blue economy.",Research,

The project will also examine the interconnectedness between labor issues, overfishing, and other forms of illegality at sea. The study will draw on the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the ILO Convention on Work in Fishing (C188), and ILO indicators of decent work to develop a holistic methodology for studying, defining and promoting decent work in fisheries. The ultimate goal is to develop the foundations for a more balanced global assessment of human and labor rights abuses in fisheries, moving us beyond the geographic focus of many recent initiatives (e.g., on Southeast Asia), and directly informing policy solutions and action agendas at multiple scales. This year, the focus will be on developing an in-depth case study on the Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas) fishery in Peru. ",Research,

 Meg Keen","International and regional organisations promote transparency on the basis that it can improve the sustainability of fisheries, yet the processes involved, and the outcomes of transparency initiatives, are often opaque and misunderstood. This study examines efforts to improve transparency in the tuna fisheries of the Pacific Island region, with our analysis focusing on members of the Pacific Islands Forum, excluding metropolitan countries New Zealand and Australia. It draws on a tripartite framework to examine transparency initiatives and outcomes associated with the Pacific Islands' tuna fisheries. It finds that efforts to improve transparency have mainly focused on increasing or sustaining economic gains for the region‚Äôs governments but much less on enhancing transparency of policy-making, decision-making and policy outcomes, especially at the domestic level. Weaknesses in regional and national institutions, and concerns about corruption, overfishing, and sustainability persist. We argue that to improve transparency and sustainability in the fisheries of the Pacific Island region, policy makers and researchers need to better understand and respond to the multiple interests and actors shaping behaviour in the tuna fisheries between different administrative scales.",Complete,Y

This paper will examine the fisheries CMM process within the broader framework of international law and policy for marine resource governance. It will consider transparency aspects at key stages of the CMM process including the gathering and sharing of data upon which measures are based, the tabling and negotiation of new measures in RFMO meetings, through to the monitoring and enforcement of CMM to ensure their implementation.

Whale-based food products are part of the diet of a majority (77%) of SVG residents. Working closely with SVG government health officials, project collaborators hope to positively impact healthy food production strategies in this small-island developing state.",Research,

Questions that will be addressed are: How can coastal resource users and industries adapt to Ocean Acidification? To what extent is acidification of the Seto Sea driven by CO2 vs. by other inputs? How can locally-collected water chemistry monitoring data (e.g., pH) be used to enable marine resource users (e.g., seaweed growers) to make informed decisions? How does adaptation to acidification change when no large, industrial players drive the adaptation process?",Research,

Using a multicultural and decolonial lens, this study critically examines the compatibility and incongruencies between local communities and environmental protection regulations facilitated by centralized government systems, with the hope of emphasizing cultural and biological diversity. While focusing on the epistemologies and ontologies of local community members, the behavior and goals of management efforts are also considered to highlight the importance of co-management and acknowledge the diversity of perspectives and methodologies fostering ecosystem protection and cultural needs.

"Fish Scales: The Production of Scale Mismatch and Inequity
in Tuna Fisheries Management","Yoshi Ota,

Elizabeth Havice","This project will critically examine the role of scale and scalar 
assumptions in tuna management. Tuna management is currently undertaken by five tuna regional fisheries management organizations (TRFMOs). These intergovernmental organizations bring together coastal and fishing states to deliberate on the conservation and management of regional tuna stocks. It is widely assumed that the TRFMO system addresses a scale mismatch between the regional distribution of tuna stocks and international participation in tuna fisheries by vessels flagged to multiple states. This project challenges the assumption that the TRFMO system solves scale mismatch. Instead, this project will use a critical conception of scale to investigate how scale is produced and contested through the TRFMO system, with particular equity consequences for tuna management. The project will center around three case studies of tuna stocks that problematize scalar assumptions in TRFMO management. These stocks are socio-economically significant to bordering developing coastal states and have limited subregional distributions. By analyzing how each case study is impacted by scalar assumptions, this project will shed light on the role scale plays in the effectiveness and equitability of the TRFMO system.",Research,

University of Washington (School of Marine and Environmental Affairs)",Yoshi Ota,47.65247454,-122.3143436,"This project aims to combat the negative effects of marine habitat loss and biodiversity. The initial aim of this project was to address the decline of seaweed forest ecosystems through integrating the seaweed-growing abilities of rope-based seaweed agriculture with the modular design systems of traditional weaving crafts and tensile architecture. The project has since expanded in scope to develop SeaWeaver as a framework to develop concepts specific to a variety of coastal ecosystems, most significantly those of tropical coral reefs and seagrass beds. Since this transition, the next step has been developing testable concepts and building connections to get them installed into those environments for testing.¬† ","This project aims to combat the negative effects of marine habitat loss and biodiversity. Techniques from seaweed rope-farming will be combined with traditional weaving crafts to develop a low-cost, low-density underwater structure that supports the growth of marine plants and the ecosystems around them. This structure will be placed in areas that have suffered from habitat loss, and bring biodiversity back into vacated waters.",Research,
